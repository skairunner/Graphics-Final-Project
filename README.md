# Terrainscape

We will create an interactive, exploratory experience where the user can explore a procedurally generated world.

The current, tentative work division is as follows:

- Tika Khanna: UI/UX
- Skye Im: Terrain generation
- Junior Maciel: Rendering terrain
- Michael Yang: Generating decorations

# How to start
Run the command `yarn install`. All dependencies will be installed. 
Next, for development run `yarn start`. The webpack server will start and open the right page.
For building, run `yarn build`, which should compile and emit the files to dist/.
