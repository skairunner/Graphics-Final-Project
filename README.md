#Terrainscape

We will create an interactive, exploratory experience where the user can explore a procedurally generated world.

The current, tentative work division is as follows:

- Tika Khanna: UI/UX
- Skye Im: Terrain generation
- Junior Maciel: Rendering terrain
- Michael Yang: Generating decorations
